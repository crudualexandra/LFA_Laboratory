### Course: Formal Languages & Finite Automata

### Author: Crudu Alexandra

## Theory

One of the core concepts in the study of formal languages and finite automata is the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), named after linguist Noam Chomsky. CNF provides a standardized way of expressing grammars, where each production rule conforms to a specific format. A grammar is in CNF if every production is either of the form A → BC or A → a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Converting grammars to CNF is essential because it enables the use of efficient parsing algorithms.

Transforming an arbitrary context-free grammar into CNF involves several methodical steps that simplify the grammar without changing the language it generates. These steps include eliminating null productions (which derive the empty string), removing unit productions (where one non-terminal maps directly to another), discarding non-productive symbols (symbols that do not lead to terminal strings), and eliminating unreachable symbols (symbols that cannot be derived from the start symbol). Finally, all remaining rules must be adjusted to comply with the CNF structure. This transformation process is not merely mechanical—it requires a solid understanding of the grammar’s structure and the language it defines.

## Objectives

1. Learn about Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).
2. Get familiar with the approaches of normalizing a grammar.
3. Implement a method for normalizing an input grammar by the rules of CNF.
    1. The implementation needs to be encapsulated in a method with an appropriate signature (also ideally in an appropriate class/type).
    2. The implemented functionality needs executed and tested.
    3. A **BONUS point** will be given for the student who will have unit tests that validate the functionality of the project.
    4. Also, another **BONUS point** would be given if the student will make the aforementioned function to accept any grammar, not only the one from the student's variant.

## Implementation description

### Grammar Class

The Grammar type is a lightweight Swift wrapper around a context-free grammar.
It stores non-terminals (VN), terminals (VT), the production map (P) and the start symbol (S), and exposes one public entry-point toCNF() that chains the five normalisation passes.

```swift

final class Grammar {
    // --- core data ---------------------------------------------------------
    private(set) var VN: [String]              // non-terminals
    private(set) var VT: [String]              // terminals
    private var        P : [String:[String]]   // rules  A → α
    private let        S : String              // start symbol
    private let ε = "ε"

    // --- ctor --------------------------------------------------------------
    init(nonTerminals: [String],
         terminals   : [String],
         rules       : [String:[String]],
         start       : String)
    {
        self.VN = nonTerminals
        self.VT = terminals
        self.P  = rules.mapValues { Array($0) } // copy for safety
        self.S  = start
    }

    // --- public API --------------------------------------------------------
    func toCNF(printSteps: Bool = false) {
        eliminateEpsilonProductions()
        eliminateRenaming()
        eliminateInaccessibleSymbols()
        eliminateNonProductiveSymbols()
        reshapeToCNF()                          // binarise + de-terminalise
        eliminateInaccessibleSymbols()          // final clean-up
        eliminateNonProductiveSymbols()
        if printSteps { dump() }
    }

    func dump() { VN.forEach { print("\($0) → \((P[$0] ?? []).joined(separator: " | "))") } }
}

```

###  Remove ε-productions  

Finds every nullable non-terminal, then rebuilds each rule with all combinations in which nullable symbols are optionally omitted.

```swift
private func eliminateEpsilonProductions() {
    var nullable = Set(VN.filter { P[$0]?.contains(ε) == true })

    var changed = true
    while changed {
        changed = false
        for A in VN where !nullable.contains(A) {
            if (P[A] ?? []).contains(where: { $0.allSatisfy { nullable.contains(String($0)) } }) {
                nullable.insert(A); changed = true
            }
        }
    }

    P = P.mapValues { prods in
        Set(prods.flatMap { $0 == ε ? [] : expandNullable($0, nullable) })
    }.mapValues(Array.init)
}
```


### Eliminate unit / renaming rules

Repeats until no production of the form A → B (single non-terminal) survives.

```swift

private func eliminateRenaming() {
    var changed = true
    while changed {
        changed = false
        for A in VN {
            let units = (P[A] ?? []).filter(VN.contains)
            for B in units {
                P[A]! += P[B] ?? [];  P[A]! = Array(Set(P[A]!.filter{ $0 != B }))
                changed = true
            }
        }
    }
}


```

###  Prune inaccessible symbols

Breadth-first search from S; any symbol never discovered is removed.

```swift

private func eliminateInaccessibleSymbols() {
    var reach: Set<String> = [S]
    var queue = [S]

    while let A = queue.popLast() {
        for p in P[A] ?? [] {
            for ch in p where VN.contains(String(ch)) && !reach.contains(String(ch)) {
                reach.insert(String(ch)); queue.append(String(ch))
            }
        }
    }

    VN = VN.filter(reach.contains)
    P   = P.filter { reach.contains($0.key) }
}


```
### Prune non-productive symbols

Keeps only symbols that can ultimately yield a terminal string.

```swift

private func eliminateNonProductiveSymbols() {
    var productive = Set<String>()
    var changed = true
    while changed {
        changed = false
        for A in VN where !productive.contains(A) {
            if (P[A] ?? []).contains(where: { $0.allSatisfy {
                VT.contains(String($0)) || productive.contains(String($0)) }}) {
                productive.insert(A); changed = true
            }
        }
    }
    VN = VN.filter(productive.contains)
    P   = P.compactMapValues { $0.filter {
        $0.allSatisfy { ch in VT.contains(String(ch)) || productive.contains(String(ch)) } }
    }.filter { productive.contains($0.key) }
}



```
### Reshape to CNF (binarise & lift terminals)
Introduces fresh non-terminals for every two-symbol slice and for lone terminals inside pairs.

```swift

private func reshapeToCNF() {
    var rhs2nt = [String:String]()
    var newP   = [String:Set<String>](uniqueKeysWithValues: VN.map { ($0, []) })

    func lift(_ x: String) -> String {
        rhs2nt[x] ?? { let v = createNewNonTerminal(); rhs2nt[x] = v; newP[v] = [x]; return v }()
    }

    // 5-a  break long RHS
    for (A, prods) in P {
        for var α in prods {
            while α.count > 2 {
                let head = String(α.prefix(2))
                α = lift(head) + α.dropFirst(2)
            }
            newP[A, default: []].insert(α)
        }
    }

    // 5-b  replace terminals inside length-2 rules
    for A in VN {
        for α in newP[A] ?? [] where α.count == 2 {
            var β = ""
            for ch in α { β += VT.contains(String(ch)) ? lift(String(ch)) : String(ch) }
            if β != α { newP[A]!.remove(α); newP[A]!.insert(β) }
        }
    }

    P = newP.mapValues(Array.init)
}



```

### Checklist against the five requirements from the output


| **Requirement**                                  | **final CNF** |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Only CNF-shaped productions** <br> – either `A → BC` (two non-terminals) or `A → a` (single terminal) | ✔ Every right-hand side is length 1 with a terminal (`a`, `d`) or length 2 with non-terminals (`FI`, `AB`, `HB`, `JJ`, …). |
| **No ε-productions** <br> (except possibly `S → ε`) | ✔ `ε` is gone and `S` does not derive it. |
| **No unit / renaming productions** <br> (`A → B`) | ✔ No single non-terminal appears on the right-hand side alone. |
| **All non-terminals reachable from `S`** | ✔ From `S` you reach `F, I, A, B, G, H, D, J, C, E` through the chain:<br> `S → FI` (gives `F, I`), `S → AB`, …<br> `F → EJ` brings in `E`, so every symbol listed is reachable. |
| **All non-terminals productive** <br> (eventually yield a terminal string) | ✔ `J → a`, `H → d`, so `{J, H}` are immediately productive;<br> every other NT rewrites to them, so all are productive. |

 


## Conclusion

The Swift implementation delivers a self-contained, language-preserving converter that takes context-free grammar and outputs an equivalent grammar in Chomsky Normal Form.

It encapsulates grammar data in a single `Grammar` type and exposes one public call — `toCNF()` — so the caller never interacts with internal details.

Internally, five concise passes — ε-removal, unit-removal, reachability, productivity, and CNF reshaping — are executed in sequence, each comprising only a few dozen lines and relying solely on Swift’s standard collections.

Fresh helper non-terminals are generated dynamically, and a final clean-up ensures that all remaining symbols are reachable, productive, and fully CNF-compliant.

Unit tests confirm the correctness of the transformation pipeline for the laboratory’s Variant 10 grammar and for randomly generated grammars, demonstrating its general applicability.

In short, this codebase transforms arbitrary CFGs into a standard form ready for CYK parsing or further theoretical analysis, while remaining lightweight, readable, and thoroughly test-driven.
